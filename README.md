The  proposed  system  is  designed  with  both RFID and finger print sensor as an entrance permitting key.This project aims at a entry system, especially in case of access control systems to allow only the entry of authenticated and authorized personnel to secure spaces. Here, a developed security system with automatic sensing is introduced by the use of both Radio frequency identification (RFID) card tagging system and fingerprint sensing biometric security system to maintain the valid access of a person to a secured place.

The system  combines  RFID  technology  and a finger print sensor module to accomplish the required task.When the RFID reader installed at the entrance detects an RFID tag, the system captures the user unique identifier (UID) and compares it with the stored UID on the microcontroller for a match then the system asks for the user fingerprint UID and compares it with the stored UID.If the user UID(RFID card and fingerprint) match with  any  of  the  stored UID, access is granted, otherwise access is denied.
